    "and the rest of the integers in the array will be in sorted order and will represent the desks\n",

    " where desk #1 is at the top left, desk #2 is at the top right, desk #3 is below #1, desk #4 is below #2, etc. \n",
    " Your program should return the number of ways 2 students can be seated next to each other. \n",
    " This means 1 student is on the left and 1 student on the right, or 1 student is directly above or below the other student. \n",
    "For example: if arr is [12, 2, 6, 7, 11] then this classrooms looks like the following diagram: \n",

    "Based on above arrangement of occupied desks, there are a total of 6 ways ([1,3][3,4][3,5][8,10][9,10][10,12]) to seat 2 new students next to each other. The combinations are: [1, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [8, 10], [9, 10], [10, 12]. So for this input your program should return 6. K will range from 2 to 24 and will always be an even number. After K, the number of occupied desks in the array can range from 0 to K. \n",
